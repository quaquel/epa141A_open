    "#### 1. Sensitivity analysis\n",
    "Sensitivity analysis often focuses on the final values of an outcome at the end of the simulation. However, we can also look at metrics that give us additional information about the behavior of the model over time. Using [the statsmodel library](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and an appropriate sampling design, fit a linear regression model for each of the following indicators. What can we conclude about the behavior of the model, and about the importance of the different inputs?\n",

    "#### 2. SOBOL\n",
    "Use the Sobol sampling functionality included in the Workbench to perform experiments with a sample size of N=50, then analyze the results with SALib for the same three indicators. This requires specifying the keyword argument `'uncertainty_sampling'` of perform_experiments. Note that when using Sobol sampling, the meaning of the keyword argument `scenarios` changes a bit. In order to properly estimate Sobol scores as well as interaction effects, you require N * (2D+2) scenarios, where D is the number of uncertain parameters, and N is the value for scenarios passed to `perform_experiments`. Repeat the analysis for larger sample sizes, with N=250 and N=1000. How can we interpret the first-order and total indices? Are these sample sizes sufficient for a stable estimation of the indices? You'll need to use the [get_SALib_problem](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/salib_samplers.html) function to convert your Workbench experiments to a problem definition that you can pass to the SALib analysis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "*hint*: sobol is a deterministic sequence of quasi random numbers. Thus, you can run with N=1000 and simply use slicing to get the results for N=50 and N=250."

    "Use the [Extra-Trees analysis](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/analysis/feature_scoring.html) included in the Workbench to approximate the Sobol total indices, with a suitable sampling design. As a starting point, use an ensemble of 100 trees and a max_features parameter of 0.6, and set the analysis to regression mode. Are the estimated importances stable relative to the sample size and the analysis parameters? How do the results compare to the Sobol indices?

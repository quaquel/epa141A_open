    "# Multi-Scenario MORDM\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-scenario MORMD is an extension of normal MORDM to better include robustness considerations within the search phase. It starts from the scenario discovery results resulting from MORDM. Next, from the experiments within this box, a set of scenarios is selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of selecting the additional scenarios. The original paper which introduced multi-scenario MORMD [Watson and Kaspzryk (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.12.001) did it in a more or less adhoc manner. [Eker and Kwakkel (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.029) introduced a more formal selection approach, the code of which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sibeleker/MORDM---Multi-scenario-search). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, make an informed selection of 4 scenarios, using an approach of your choice. Motivate carefully your selection procedure. \n"

As a rule of thumb, try to limit the set of policies to at most 50. \n",

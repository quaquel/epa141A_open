    "This exercise uses a simple version of the [Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) to show how the EMA Workbench can be used for a\n",
    "multi-model analysis, in addition to typical parametric/structural uncertainties. This will let you test the connectors provided in the Workbench for Excel, NetLogo, and Vensim / PySD; we'll also use the models for the sensitivity analysis exercise in week 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the three model files provided and the Python function below, define model objects for each implementation (Excel, NetLogo, Vensim/PySD, and Python), and test them using a single ensemble. Use 50 experiments sampled from the parameters below (so that each experiment will be executed for the 4 models, for a total of 200), and retrieve outputs for the _TIME_, _predators_, and _prey_ variables.\n",

    "* Note that your EMA Workbench installation includes example scripts for the different connectors. The different model objects follow a similar syntax but will need to be slightly adjusted depending on the software (e.g. to specify the NetLogo run length or the sheet name in Excel). You might need to install [NetLogo 6.0](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.0.1/) and pip install JPype1 (for the NetLogo connector) and PySD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These model objects can be used with a replication functionality (for instance to test the effect of stochastic uncertainty in a NetLogo model), which repeats a given experiment over multiple replications. You can use a single replication in this exercise as the models are not stochastic. By default, each outcome array will then have a shape of (# experiments, # replications, # time steps). Try adapting the outcome arrays so that they can be used with the _lines_ plotting function of the Workbench, and plot the results grouped by model.\n",
